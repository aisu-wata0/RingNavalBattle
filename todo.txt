		vector starts at 0, but players at 1
		
		on the vector position of your id, store the next player (my_id+1)?
		or just store yourself on a single vector of boards instead?

			(master)send a message and wait for you to receive it, you will receive it back when the ring is complete (put a sleep between tries)
			
			for each dorei that the message passes through, make it +1 a field on the setup_msg, when the message arrives to the master it will know how many players there are
			(or just make 4 players and thats it)
				after the tally, pass a message with the player_n, if the player id is >= player_n give error
			
			(?)check if no duplicate player ids
			
			choose:
				p1 passes turn no next player (with baton), might or might not be self proclaimed p2
				or
				p1 passes turn to p2 (send_msg) and baton to next
				noone (aside from p2) will have msg to send, so the baton will pass forward until p2 receives it
